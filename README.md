## Introduction

A Robotic arm is a type of mechanical arm, usually programmable, with 
similar functions to a human arm; the arm may be the sum total of the 
mechanism or may be part of a more complex robot. The links of such a 
manipulator are connected by joints allowing either rotational motion (such as 
in an articulated robot) or translational (linear) displacement. They are mainly
used for pick and place work, application of sealant, assembly operations, 
handling machine tools and arc welding. In this project we have used four 
Servo Motors to show the movement of a robotic arm.

## Design Steps and Circuit Explanation

Our project consists of 3 main parts:

1) Servo Motors (Robotic Arms). 
2) LCD for displaying the movement of Arms.
3) Keypad for movement of Arms.

## Procedure

• Firstly, we started our working on the servo motor motion to explain the 
movement of arms in different directions (like anti-clockwise for 
upward).
• Then we moved to Keypad control for our servo motors.
• And lastly, we designed LCD interfacing for our locomotion and 
movement units of arms.

## Problems Faced

The Servo Motor did not stop after one complete cycle.

## Results Achieved

We have successfully created Robotic Arm using Atmel 89C51. The Servo
Motors work properly and show the locomotion as displayed on LCD.

## Recommended Future Work

The things that could have been added were:
• Using the cartesian coordinates (x, y, z) input from user to define the 
locomotion of Robotic Arm.
• Saving the movement and the automatic locomotion.
